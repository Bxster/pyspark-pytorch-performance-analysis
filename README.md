# pyspark-pytorch-performance-analysis
This repository contains the source code and results for a project focused on the performance analysis of distributed deep learning on a multi-core CPU environment. The goal is to compare the training time of a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) in a standalone PyTorch setup versus a distributed setup with PySpark's TorchDistributor.
